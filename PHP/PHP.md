## what is PHP
PHP is an acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor", a widely-used, open source scripting language. PHP scripts are executed on the server.

## what r the three main error types in PHP
- Parse error or Syntax Error: It is the type of error done by the programmer in the source code of the program. The syntax error is caught by the compiler.
- Fatal Error: It is the type of error where PHP compiler understand the PHP code but it recognizes an undeclared function. This means that function is called without the definition of function.
- Warning Errors : The main reason of warning errors are including a missing file. This means that the PHP function call the missing file.
- Notice Error: It is similar to warning error. It means that the program contains something wrong but it allows the execution of script.

## echo vs print
The differences are small:
- echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions.
- echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument.
- echo is marginally faster than print.

## sensitivity in PHP
PHP is partially case-sensitive.
PHP constructs, function names, class names are case-insensitive, whereas variables are case-sensitive.
