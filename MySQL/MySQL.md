## What is the SQL?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It enables users to perform a variety of tasks such as querying data, creating and modifying database structures, and managing access permissions.

## What is the history of MySQL?
MySQL was created by a Swedish company MySQL AB in 1995. The developers of the platform were Michael Widenius (Monty), David Axmark and Allan Larsson. In 2000, MySQL went open source, so it could be accessed and used by all. In the year 2002, MySQL launched its headquarters in USA, in addition to Sweden headquarters. In 2005, MySQL launched MySQL Network. Oracle purchased Innobase, which is the backend of MySQL's InnoDB storage. In 2008, MySQL was acquired by Sun Microsystems.
In 2009, Sun Microsystems and Oracle entered intoa definitive agreement under which Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems.
