## How the web works
- Your personal computer − This is the PC at which you sit to see the web.
- A Web browser − A software installed on your PC which helps you to browse the Web.
- An internet connection − This is provided by an ISP and connects you to the internet to reach to any Website.
- A Web server − This is the computer on which a website is hosted.
- Routers & Switches − They are the combination of software and hardware who take your request and pass to appropriate Web server.

## HTTP vs HTTPS
https is secure, HTTP messages are plaintext, which means unauthorized parties can easily access and read them over the internet. In contrast, HTTPS transmits all data in encrypted form. 

## Web Servers
A web server is a system that stores and delivers web pages to users. The end user processes a request via a web browser installed on a web server. The communication between a web server or browser and the end user takes place using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The primary role of a web server is to store, process, and deliver requested information or webpages to end users. There are different types such as: Apache Web Server, Nginx Web Server, LiteSpeed Web Server, etc.

## DNS
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. The process of DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (such as www.example.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1). An IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and that address is necessary to find the appropriate Internet device - like a street address is used to find a particular home. When a user wants to load a webpage, a translation must occur between what a user types into their web browser (example.com) and the machine-friendly address necessary to locate the example.com webpage.
